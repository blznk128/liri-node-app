This assignment was a rough one. Especially the spotify api, got a lot of "spotify is not defined" errors. I spent about 15 hours on this, doesn't seem that long but with work , etc... I feel if I had more time I could of finished 100 percent and done the bonus. I tried to use the .env to supply the keys but couldn't figure it out and i believe the movie-this and concert-this doesnt concadenate(spell check) words very well, especially the concert-this, if you do concert-this shawn mendes   it says venue not defined and movie-this when you use multiple words it only uses the first word in the url, weird. But i got all the basic functions to work and I am proud what i accomplished. Another big issue was digging into JSON strings and pulling the ones you want, need more practice on that bad boy. Biggest issue with spotify is the syntax, bands and omen api was straight forward, mostly, and the spotify one was insane. It kept doing things like when i typed "concert-this" it would add it into my url link so messed up a lot of stuff and also added spaces into my links and messed it up again. 
I uploaded the video on to youtube cause to do a gif it wanted me to pay some dough and I aint about that.
